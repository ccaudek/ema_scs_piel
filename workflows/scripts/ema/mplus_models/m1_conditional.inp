TITLE: Simplified conditional random variability model for momentary CS;
DATA:
  FILE = ema_data.dat;

VARIABLE:
  NAMES = user_id_numeric bysubj_day time_window CurAve_d FSMean;
  USEVARIABLES = CurAve_d FSMean;
  CLUSTER = user_id_numeric; ! Numeric ID for Level-2 clustering
  BETWEEN = FSMean; ! FSMean (DERS) as a Level-2 predictor

ANALYSIS:
  TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM; ! Multilevel random effects model
  ESTIMATOR = BAYES; ! Bayesian estimation
  CHAINS = 3; ! Number of MCMC chains
  BITERATIONS = 100000 (5000); ! Maximum iterations and burn-in
  CONVERGENCE = 1.10; ! Relax convergence criterion if needed
  PROCESSORS = 2; ! Parallel computation
  ALGORITHM = GIBBS(RW); ! Use Gibbs sampling with random walk

MODEL:
  %WITHIN%
    CurAve_d; ! Momentary variation in CurAve_d (random variance modeled at Level 1)

  %BETWEEN%
    [CurAve_d] (gamma00); ! Between-level intercept of CS
    [FSMean] (gamma20); ! Between-level intercept of FSMean (DERS)
    CurAve_d (phi_0); ! Variance of between-level CS
    FSMean ON CurAve_d; ! Predict DERS with CS at the between level

OUTPUT:
  TECH8 CINTERVAL(HPD); ! Request iteration history and HPD intervals
