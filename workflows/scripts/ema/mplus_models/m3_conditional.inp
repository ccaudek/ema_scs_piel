TITLE: Simplified conditional model focusing on CS variability;
DATA:
  FILE = ema_data.dat;

VARIABLE:
  NAMES = user_id_numeric bysubj_day time_window CurAve_d FSMean;
  USEVARIABLES = CurAve_d FSMean;
  CLUSTER = user_id_numeric; ! Numeric ID for Level-2 clustering
  BETWEEN = FSMean; ! FSMean (DERS) as a Level-2 predictor

ANALYSIS:
  TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM; ! Multilevel random effects model
  ESTIMATOR = BAYES; ! Bayesian estimation
  CHAINS = 3; ! Number of MCMC chains
  BITERATIONS = 100000 (5000); ! Maximum iterations and burn-in
  PROCESSORS = 2; ! Parallel computation
  ALGORITHM = GIBBS(RW); ! Use Gibbs sampling with random walk

MODEL:
  %WITHIN%
    LOGV | CurAve_d; ! Log residual variance modeled as random coefficients

  %BETWEEN%
    [CurAve_d*0] (gamma00); ! Informative prior for intercept of CS (N(0, 1))
    [LOGV*-1] (gamma10);    ! Informative prior for intercept of log residual variance (N(-1, 1))
    [FSMean*0] (gamma20);   ! Informative prior for intercept of FSMean (DERS, N(0, 1))

    CurAve_d (phi_0); ! Variance of between-level CS
    LOGV (phi_1);     ! Variance of between-level log residual variance

    FSMean ON CurAve_d LOGV (beta1 beta2); ! Predict DERS with average CS and variability

MODEL PRIORS:
    phi_0 ~ IG(1, 0.1);   ! Informative inverse-gamma prior for variance of average CS
    phi_1 ~ IG(1, 0.1);   ! Informative inverse-gamma prior for variance of variability
    beta1 ~ N(0, 1);      ! Informative prior for beta1
    beta2 ~ N(0, 1);      ! Informative prior for beta2

MODEL CONSTRAINT:
  NEW (mean_v var_v); ! Derived parameters for within-level residual variance
  mean_v = exp(gamma10 + (1/2)*phi_1); ! Mean of the within-level variance
  var_v = exp(2*gamma10 + phi_1)*(exp(phi_1)-1); ! Variance of the within-level variance

OUTPUT:
  TECH8 CINTERVAL(HPD); ! Request iteration history and HPD intervals
