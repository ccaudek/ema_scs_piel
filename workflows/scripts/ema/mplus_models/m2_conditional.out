  TITLE: Refined conditional random variability model for momentary CS;
  DATA:
    FILE = ema_data.dat;

  VARIABLE:
    NAMES = user_id_numeric bysubj_day time_window CurAve_d FSMean;
    USEVARIABLES = CurAve_d FSMean;
    CLUSTER = user_id_numeric; ! Numeric ID for Level-2 clustering
    BETWEEN = FSMean; ! FSMean (DERS) as a Level-2 predictor

  ANALYSIS:
    TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM; ! Multilevel random effects model
    ESTIMATOR = BAYES; ! Bayesian estimation
    CHAINS = 3; ! Number of MCMC chains
    BITERATIONS = 100000 (5000); ! Maximum iterations and burn-in
    CONVERGENCE = 1.10; ! Relax convergence criterion if needed
    PROCESSORS = 2; ! Parallel computation
    ALGORITHM = GIBBS(RW); ! Use Gibbs sampling with random walk

  MODEL:
    %WITHIN%
      LOGV | CurAve_d; ! Log residual variance modeled as random coefficients

    %BETWEEN%
      [CurAve_d] (gamma00); ! Between-level intercept of CS
      [LOGV] (gamma10); ! Between-level intercept of log residual variance
      [FSMean] (gamma20); ! Between-level intercept of FSMean (DERS)

      CurAve_d (phi_0); ! Variance of between-level CS
      LOGV (phi_1); ! Variance of between-level log residual variance

      CurAve_d WITH LOGV (phi_10); ! Correlation between average CS and variability
      LOGV WITH FSMean (phi_11); ! Correlation between variability and DERS
      FSMean ON CurAve_d LOGV; ! Predict DERS with average CS and variability

  MODEL CONSTRAINT:
    NEW (mean_v var_v); ! Derived parameters for within-level residual variance
    mean_v = exp(gamma10 + (1/2)*phi_1); ! Mean of the within-level variance
    var_v = exp(2*gamma10 + phi_1)*(exp(phi_1)-1); ! Variance of the within-level variance

  OUTPUT:
    TECH8 CINTERVAL(HPD); ! Request iteration history and HPD intervals
